# React Native Setup with Expo Go

## üìå Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This guide walks through setting up **Expo Go** on your physical device, which will allow you to run and test React Native applications easily.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
Before setting up Expo Go, make sure you already have the following installed:
- **Node.js LTS**  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äì recommended IDE  
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** operating system  

Additionally, you‚Äôll need a physical device:
- **Android phone** or  
- **iOS device (iPhone/iPad)**

## üöÄ Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile development usually requires device emulators to test apps. Running multiple emulators for the latest devices (e.g., iPhone 16 Pro Max, new Android flagships) can be resource-heavy and costly.

**Expo Go solves this problem** by allowing you to:
- Run React Native apps directly on your **physical device**
- Test apps seamlessly on both **iOS and Android**
- Avoid setting up complex emulators
